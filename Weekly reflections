Week 1. This week I worked on reading through the material of the assignment and began planning out what I should do for Btree. This week included setting up the repo and getting a feel for working as a team using Scrum practices. Teammate Participation (Devyn 5/5) (James 5/5)
Week 2. This week I got the initial checkpoint done on the Btree end. This meant we were passing atleast the constructor tests for Btree. Teammate Participation (Devyn 5/5) (James 5/5)
Week 3. This week I did't have much of a chance to work on the assignment, but thanks to the work by my teamamates I feel I am in a good spot to work on finishing up Btree before the second checkpoint is due next week. Teammate Participation (Devyn 5/5) (James 5/5)
Week 4. This week I finished up my part of the second checkpoint. This meant learning how to interact Btree with the disk and wokring with permanent data storage. There were a few hiccups along the way, but I think we should be good to go. Teammate Participation (Devyn 5/5) (James 5/5)
Week 5. This week I worked on finishing up the project to be ready for grading. I worked on optimizing Btree, utilizing the project 1 cache, and getting everything running in AWS. Teammate Participation (Devyn 5/5) (James 5/5)
