First and formost, this is the most tedious and rediclous way to keep track of sprint info. 
I have worked in industry for multiple years and there is no way anyone would ever do this without writing a script. 
That being said I have a million things more important than writing a script for this. So here.  
The real tracking of progress was done via group chat and github issues. 

# Sprint 1 (Week 1 and 2)

1. [SSHSearchDB w/o validation]#[IssueNumber] commit [CommitHash] `(A)`
2. [Args validation for seach and create] #[IssueNumber] commit [CommitHash] `(A)`
3. [Action] #[IssueNumber] commit [CommitHash] `(StudentName)`

# Sprint 2 (Week 3 and 4)

1. [SSH Create BTree] #[IssueNumber] commit [CommitHash] `(A)`
2. [File reader] #[IssueNumber] commit [CommitHash] `(A)`
3. [Test Coverage on create, search db] #[IssueNumber] commit [CommitHash] `(A)`

# TODO
